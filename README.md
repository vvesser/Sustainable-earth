# greensustainableearth
A blog that will describe a real plan for a green sustainable earth! 

Every major detail will be addressed and Real world solutions will be given. Although other options do exist
it will show that we can sustain out earth. Participation will be encouraged and people will be able to add
alternative options or give links to alt-opts. 

It will be an Issue - Alternative style page! Any "real" non-profit like Greenpeace or Working America will have the option 
to add donation links and Global News.

Latest Green and Clean Technology will be featured and also have the opportunity to add links after verification

New green and clean global projects along with longstanding ones will be linked and written about including how they can be 
implemented into the Total Global Plan! 

Each country will eventually be given a page to share their own plans and upcomming projects. 

The worlds biggest polluters and carbon contributers will be given the opportunity to ask for help in converting 
their companies into truely sustainable ones. Here countries and global citizens can offer ideas to polluters that maximize 
the use of their assets and help them see new ideas they can embrace in turning their negitives into positives.
